                    <p class="i8">Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist and former chairman of Tata Sons. He was also the chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, serving also as interim chairman from October 2016 through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable trusts.
                        In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the 
                        third highest civilian honour in 2000.

                        He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group.
                        He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in architecture, and the Harvard
                        Business School through a management course he completed in 1975.[5] He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop
                         floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. 
                         Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely 
                         India-centric group into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated 
                         around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.

                        Tata, the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, was a 
                        member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents separated, and he was 
                        subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji Tata.
                        He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata[8] and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second marriage 
                        with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.

                        He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class. After which, he studied at the Cathedral and 
                        John Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the Riverdale Country School in New 
                        York City, which he graduated from in 1955. After graduating from high school, Tata enrolled in Cornell 
                        University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1959. In 1975,
                        he attended the seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard Business School, an institution which he
                        has since endowed.

            <p>Tata has never married and has no children. In 2011, Ratan Tata stated, "I came close to getting married four times and each time I backed off in fear or for one reason 
               or another."

            <h3 id="i6"><u>Career</u></h3><br><br>
            <div>
                <p>In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and 
                    Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons
                    , naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational 
                    freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the 
                    implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit 
                    to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent. Under his leadership, 
                    overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on 
                    globalisation.</p>
